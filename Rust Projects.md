Starting with mini projects is a fantastic way to learn Rust! Here are some project ideas that can help you explore different aspects of the language while building something useful:

### **1. Command-Line Tools**
   - **Task Manager**: Build a simple to-do list manager that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks via the command line.
   - **File Organizer**: Create a CLI tool that organizes files in a directory based on file type or date.
   - **Weather CLI**: Fetch and display the current weather for a given location using a weather API like OpenWeatherMap.

### **2. Web Development**
   - **URL Shortener**: Build a basic URL shortening service using Rocket or Actix, where users can input long URLs and receive a shorter version.
   - **Simple Blog Engine**: Develop a minimalistic blog engine where users can create, edit, and delete posts. This can be a great way to learn web server basics and CRUD operations.
   - **Chat Application**: Create a real-time chat application using WebSockets. This will help you understand Rust's concurrency model.

### **3. Networking**
   - **HTTP Server**: Implement a simple HTTP server that can serve static files. This will teach you about networking and asynchronous programming in Rust.
   - **TCP Chat Server**: Build a TCP-based chat server where multiple clients can connect and send messages to each other.
   - **Port Scanner**: Develop a network scanner that checks for open ports on a given IP address. This is a great project to learn about TCP connections.

### **4. Systems Programming**
   - **Memory Allocator**: Create a basic memory allocator to understand how Rust manages memory and interacts with the system's memory management.
   - **File System Explorer**: Build a tool that navigates and displays the contents of a file system, similar to the `ls` command in Unix/Linux.
   - **Custom Shell**: Implement a basic command-line shell that can execute commands, handle input/output redirection, and manage processes.

### **5. Game Development**
   - **Snake Game**: Create the classic Snake game using a game engine like Bevy. This will introduce you to game loops, rendering, and user input handling in Rust.
   - **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, either as a CLI game or with a graphical interface using a library like Piston or SDL.
   - **Flappy Bird Clone**: Recreate the Flappy Bird game to understand game physics, collision detection, and animation.

### **6. Data Processing**
   - **CSV Parser**: Develop a CSV file parser that can read, filter, and manipulate data. This is a good project to learn about file handling and string manipulation.
   - **Log File Analyzer**: Create a tool that processes and summarizes log files, such as counting error types or tracking access times.
   - **Markdown to HTML Converter**: Build a simple converter that takes a Markdown file and outputs HTML. This will involve parsing text and handling different formatting rules.

### **7. Cryptography**
   - **Password Manager**: Implement a secure password manager that encrypts and stores passwords. This is a great project to explore Rust's cryptography libraries.
   - **Simple Encryption Tool**: Create a tool that encrypts and decrypts text files using a basic encryption algorithm like Caesar cipher or AES.
   - **Blockchain Prototype**: Develop a very basic blockchain prototype to understand the fundamentals of distributed ledgers and cryptographic hashing.

### **8. Embedded Systems**
   - **LED Blinker**: If you have access to hardware like an Arduino, try writing a program to blink an LED using Rust. This will introduce you to embedded programming and interfacing with hardware.
   - **Temperature Sensor**: Create a simple project that reads data from a temperature sensor and logs it to a file or displays it on an LCD.

### **9. Automation Tools**
   - **Web Scraper**: Build a tool that scrapes data from a website and stores it in a database or a CSV file.
   - **Task Scheduler**: Develop a simple task scheduler that runs tasks at specified intervals, similar to cron jobs.
   - **Image Resizer**: Create a tool that batch resizes images to different resolutions. This will involve working with image processing libraries.

### **10. AI/ML Projects**
   - **Simple Neural Network**: Implement a basic neural network from scratch to understand the fundamentals of machine learning.
   - **Spam Filter**: Build a simple spam filter using a Naive Bayes classifier. You can train it on a small dataset of emails to classify them as spam or not.
   - **Genetic Algorithm**: Develop a genetic algorithm to solve a problem like the Traveling Salesman Problem or optimizing a function.

These projects cover a wide range of applications, from systems programming to web development, and are designed to help you grasp different aspects of Rust. Start small and gradually take on more complex projects as you become more comfortable with the language.
